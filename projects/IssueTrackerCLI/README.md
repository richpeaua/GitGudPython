# IssueTrackerCLI

## Overview

A simple issue tracker CLI program

## Goals

- Start as SIMPLE as possible.
    - Solve problem/meet objective FIRST
    - Refactor (bugfix, alternative solutions, add feature) later
- Work in small iterations (we'll call them sprints):
    - Thursday-Thursday (why? just the day I started working on this, can't be a "wait for Monday" kinda person)
    - 1-3 hour work work days for a range of 7-21 hours/sprint

## Sprints

Since I haven't built this issue tracker out yet, I'll be using a dead simple issue tracking method of creating tickets, as markdown text files, manually.

The tickets are more like logs for an entire sprint, than something like a real issue tracker ticket for individual task items.

Below is a table with each sprint log.

### Backlog

[TODO.md](./TODO.md) is the source for tasks defined in the sprints

These tasks will comprise of:
- bug fixes
- feature additions
- rollover work
